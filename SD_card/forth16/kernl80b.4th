\ PART 11: INTERPRETER HELPER WORDS

\ First we need FIND and related words.

\ Each word list consists of a number of linked list of definitions (number
\ is a power of 2). Hashing
\ is used to speed up dictionary search. All names in the dictionary
\ are at aligned addresses and FIND is optimized to compare one 4-byte
\ cell at a time.

\ Dictionary definitions are built as follows:
\
\ LINK field: 1 cell, aligned, contains name field of previous word in thread.
\ NAME field: counted string of at most 31 characters.
\             bits 5-7 of length byte have special meaning.
\                   7 is always set to mark start of name ( for >NAME)
\                   6 is set if the word is immediate.
\ CODE field: first aligned address after name, is execution token for word.
\             here the executable code for the word starts. (is 3 bytes for
\             variables etc.)
\ PARAMETER field: (body) Contains the data of constants and variables etc.

VARIABLE FORTH-WORDLIST ( --- addr)
